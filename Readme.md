## Self-analysis

I used to be an **ACMer** while I was a freshman and studied bioinformatics in the laboratory with my tutor in my sophomore time. 

Before I got employed, I felt that I was suitable to be a **product manager**, and then **experienced layoffs**. 

I made many different choices, and also experienced the lives of scientific researchers, programmers, and product managers. 

After clearing up my mood and settling down for some time, I felt that **the time to engage in ACM was my happiest time.** 

At present, I am still confused about my future, but **$\color{#FF0000}{the}$ $\color{#FF0000}{ACM}$ $\color{#FF0000}{programming}$ $\color{#FF0000}{will}$ $\color{#FF0000}{never}$ $\color{#FF0000}{stop!}$**
