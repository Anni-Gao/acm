## Self-analysis

I used to be an ACMer while I was a freshman and studied bioinformatics in the laboratory with my tutor in my sophomore time. 

Before I got employed, I felt that I was suitable to be a product manager, and then experienced layoffs. 

I made many different choices, and also experienced the lives of scientific researchers, programmers, and product managers. 

After clearing up my mood and settling down for some time, I felt that the time to engage in ACM was my happiest time. 

At present, I am still confused about my future, but the ACM will never stop!
